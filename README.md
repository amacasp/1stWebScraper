I made some really bad python code that attempts to find hyperlinks within a page. Modules required to run this are BeautifulSoup4, lxml, and requests. I would also like to credit Byte of Python for there wonderful tutorial for python, which I really recommend. Also beautifulsoup and requests have really good tutorials and in general are great modules.
